# Supported devices

[Back to the README](../README.md). How a device is read, and the source of each protocol, is in [protocols.md](protocols.md).

**`yes`** means the level has actually been seen on the device - here, from a report, or from a user who tried it. **`no`** means the support was written from another tool's code and nobody has tried it on real hardware yet. **`likely`** means other models of the same family share the code, so they should work too - they just haven't been tried one at a time. Each device links to [notes on how its level is read](protocols.md).

**PlayStation controllers over Bluetooth:** a DualShock 4 or DualSense sends its battery level over Bluetooth only in its "full report" mode. Switching a controller into that mode makes it invisible to games that use DirectInput until it is turned off and on again (#96), so the app does not switch it: the level shows while Steam or a game has already put the controller in that mode, and otherwise the icon shows the controller without a level. If you do not play such games, turn on **Preferences > PlayStation full mode (Bluetooth)** to always see the level. Over USB the level is always shown.

**8BitDo controllers in D-input mode:** the battery level is only in the controller's enhanced report. Switching the controller into that mode makes it invisible to DirectInput games until it is turned off and on (tested by the reporter of #101), so the app never switches it: the level shows while Steam or a game has already put the controller in that mode, and otherwise the icon shows the controller without a level. In XInput mode the level is always shown.

The devices marked `likely` are the same code paths with other models: the rest of the Razer list
OpenRazer reads, the other WLmouse models, more Logitech HID++ 2.0 devices and G-series headsets,
the other Arctis Nova and older Arctis models, and other Xbox-compatible controllers.
