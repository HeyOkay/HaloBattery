"""Audeze Maxwell headsets (0x3329): the USB wireless dongle and the USB cable.

The headset is reached through the vendor HID collection (usage page 0xFF13,
usage 0x0001). A request is a 62-byte output report with report id 0x06; the
answer comes back as the 62-byte input report 0x07. Its payload is a rolling
buffer holding the dongle's most recent replies, so the battery marker sits in
a different frame from poll to poll and the whole buffer has to be scanned.

One packet is enough to read the battery. The packet that asks for attribute
0x0CD6 (``BATTERY_ONLY``) is answered with the marker on its own: measured on the
dongle and on the USB-C endpoint at 0.19 s against 1.48 s for the full sequence,
and running both against each other every 30 s through a charge from 85% to 91%
agreed in 19 of 20 cycles. The cycle that differed read 90% from the single packet
against 88% from the full sequence at a moment when both neighbouring cycles read
90%, so the fuller window was carrying an older copy too: the buffer holds several
historical values and either sequence can pick one up, which is why the level can
bounce by a couple of points between polls. The full sequence stays as the
fallback whenever the single packet comes back without a marker, so a firmware
that does need the initialisation (the Xbox dongle and the Maxwell 2 are
untested) still reads; the cost of the fallback is one extra round trip per poll
while the headset is off.

The 14 packets are HeadsetControl's, byte for byte (lib/devices/audeze_maxwell.hpp,
UNIQUE_REQUESTS). Thirteen of them carry 0x80 in the byte after the length, and the
seventh - 06 07 00 05 5A 03 00 07 1C - carries 0x00. An earlier version of this
docstring claimed that byte marks a write and therefore never appears in the
sequence; that claim was asserted, not measured, and the table above disproves it.
Either that byte is not a plain read/write marker, or that one packet is not a
plain read. Since it is part of the vendor's own initialisation and HeadsetControl
sends it on every read, it stays - but the claim that the sequence writes nothing
at all is withdrawn. What is enforced instead: the sequence is only sent to the
product ids in KNOWN, and only ever to a vendor collection.

Protocol and the packet tables come from the HeadsetControl project
(Sapd/HeadsetControl, lib/devices/audeze_maxwell.hpp). The battery is their
marker ``d6 0c 00 00 <percent>``. HeadsetControl reads only the reply that
follows a packet and reports BATTERY_UNAVAILABLE on dongles where that reply
does not happen to be the one holding the marker; reading the last frame of
the whole sequence that contains the marker is what makes this work here.

Both endpoints of the headset speak the same protocol and report the same
level, measured on hardware: the 2.4 GHz dongle is 0x4B19 ("Audeze Maxwell
HID") and the USB-C cable is 0x4B1A ("Audeze Maxwell Headset"). Plugged in for
charging the headset keeps its wireless link, so both answer at once; they are
one device and get one icon, the cable winning.

There is no charging flag in the protocol: the payload of a battery answer is
exactly ``d6 0c 00 00 <percent>`` with nothing after it, HeadsetControl has no
charging value for any Audeze device, and Audeze HQ itself shows only "Battery
level is 76%." (and "USB Wired") while the headset is wired. A search for one
came up empty: firing the sequence's queries one at a time (01:09, 07:1C, 83:2C
with sub-bytes 01/07/0B, 0D6) against six frames of answer each turns up only
four kinds of record - the battery, the firmware string, echoes of the query just
sent, and the 83:2C settings block - and every one of them is byte for byte the
same while charging and while running off the dongle.

So the cable endpoint is used as the signal instead: a Maxwell charges whenever
it is on USB-C (there is no way to switch that off), which makes the cable
answering mean "on power". Its status is reported as charging, so the icon
breathes and a headset that was just plugged in is not told to charge. The
inference is one-sided on purpose: docked and already full, the icon still
breathes where the headset's own LED is solid green.

Measured with the headset switched off and the dongle left plugged in: the
dongle keeps enumerating (all three collections stay, only the audio endpoints
go away) and keeps answering every packet with the last value it held - the
marker does not disappear from its buffer, so a stale level and a live one are
indistinguishable that way (nine answers over two and a half minutes, all the
same value). The dongle does say which state it is in, though: with no headset
linked it enumerates as "Audeze Maxwell Dongle" (the Xbox dongle: "Audeze Maxwell
XBOX Dongle", #244) instead of "Audeze Maxwell HID",
and its interface paths change at the same moment, so hidlist's path-keyed cache
re-enumerates by itself and poll() sees the fresh string. poll() reads that
before anything else and reports nothing while it says Dongle: a switched-off
headset leaves the tray through the usual "two misses" path, is never reported as
0%, and its 1.5 s battery sequence is not sent at all.

Both endpoints report serial number ``0000000000000000``, so the icon key is that
serial and two Maxwells on one machine would share one icon (and only the first
would be read). Nothing that can be done about it here: the headset does not
report anything unique over HID.

With the USB-C cable plugged in instead, a switched-off headset keeps reporting
its real level on 0x4B1A: 85% while the LED showed charging, up from 83% before
the switch-off. That is the level it is charging at, so the icon stays and shows
it - the honest thing to show. The dongle goes silent in that state as well (its
buffer can still hold the last value for one poll), and since the cable is read
first a stale dongle value never wins. Windows shows no Audeze audio endpoint
while the headset is off even though both HID endpoints stay enumerated, and the
dongle's product string reads "Audeze Maxwell Dongle" instead of "Audeze Maxwell
HID" - poll() uses that to tell a switched-off headset from a live one.
