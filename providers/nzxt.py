"""NZXT Lift Elite Wireless over its dongle (1e71:2101), without NZXT CAM.

No public protocol exists for this mouse - OpenRGB's NZXT controller covers the
wired Lift's LEDs only, and CAM keeps the battery inside its closed native
module. Every byte here is therefore taken from USBPcap captures of CAM
4.76.5 talking to the reporter's own mouse (issue #148 - four captures:
wireless at 76-77 %, the charging cable in, and the mouse on its USB cable at
84 %). The conversation is a request in a 64-byte interrupt OUT report and a
reply on interrupt IN, both starting with 0x4e:

    request:  4e 02 81 00 b0 00 ...
              0x4e framing, 02 = the mouse behind the dongle, 81 = "read a
              property", 0xb0 = the telemetry property this provider wants
    reply:    4e 02 97 00 01 40 01 86 0f fd ff 40 01 f6 00 43 00 4d 00 64 ...

Field map, read off the reporter's captures (a wireless session and a charging
one):

    bytes 17-18  battery percent, little-endian (4d 00 = 77, 4c 00 = 76). The
                 tray reads one step above CAM's panel (76 against 75, 78
                 against 77) - CAM smooths its display; the raw gauge is what
                 is shown here.
    bytes 8-9    cell voltage, big-endian millivolts (0f fd = 4093 mV wireless;
                 10 fc = 4348 mV while charging; 0f 1e = 3870 right after the
                 cable came out).
    byte 22      bit 0 set while the mouse is on its charging cable: it read 1
                 in every charging-session frame and 0 in every wireless one,
                 including right after unplugging.
    byte 7       drifts between reads (86/82 wireless, 94..91 and 9b on either
                 side of charging, 1c/31/a5 during it) with nothing conclusive
                 - NOT decoded.
    bytes 13-14  a slowly moving value (00f6 = 246 up to 00f9 = 249 across the
                 captures, rising during charging) that looks like a
                 temperature in 0.1 C - NOT decoded.
    byte 10      ff wireless; 01 from mid-charging through the unplug, back to
                 ff once settled - the exact meaning is not clear, so it is
                 not used; byte 21 reads 1e normally and 1c once.
    the rest     (43 00, 64 00, 08 00, a repeated 40 01) is constant.

The reply arrived ~25 ms after the request, always preceded by a 4e e5 00
acknowledgement from the dongle, so the read loop skips e5 frames and waits
for the 97 one. A stale frame from the previous poll is drained before the
request is sent.

The dongle splits into six HID collections; the conversation rode the one on
usage page ffca / usage 0001 - the same page the wired Lift's OpenRGB driver
picks - chosen by usage page, never by interface number.

The mouse has two ids: 1e71:2101 for the receiver and 1e71:2129 for the same
mouse on its USB cable. The wired one carries the identical ffca:0001
collection with the same 64-byte report pair, and CAM read it with the very
same request (that capture holds 84 % and the charging bit, cable in) - so
both ids are asked.

Claimed for the mouse's two ids: 1e71:2101 (the receiver) and 1e71:2129 (the
mouse on its USB cable). The 1e71:2131 keyboard is wired and has no battery to
read. Confirmed on hardware by the reporter of #148 (@MrBeat93): the level
tracks, charging follows the cable. While NZXT CAM itself is open the dongle
stops answering this request - the app then keeps the last value on a greyed
icon (the same coexistence shape as other vendor tools).
