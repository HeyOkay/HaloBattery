"""Corsair wireless receivers (Void v2 Wireless and its siblings) over USB/HID,
without iCUE.

Protocol from Sapd/HeadsetControl's corsair_void_v2w device:

  * the vendor collection on the receiver, which HeadsetControl identifies by
    interface 4 (it gives no usage page/usage for it, so the interface number is
    the only handle on that collection; a probe logs whatever it actually finds).
  * commands are 65 bytes: [0] 0x00 report id, [1] 0x02, [2] endpoint,
    [3] 0x02, [4] command. Endpoint 0x08 is the receiver itself, 0x09 the
    headset behind it. Replies are 64 bytes.
  * talking to a sleeping headset needs the same minimal handshake
    HeadsetControl uses - receiver firmware query, receiver heartbeat, then a
    headset heartbeat - which is enough to read the battery without switching
    the headset into software mode (that switch is audible as a pop).
  * battery: command 0x0f to endpoint 0x09 -> reply[4] | reply[5] << 8 is a
    0..1000 value, ten times the percent. The receiver sometimes answers with
    the paired headset id instead of a level, so a reading of 0 or above 1000 is
    retried a few times and then refused rather than shown.

The reply carries no charging flag: HeadsetControl reports the level as
available (not charging) for this family, and so does this provider.

The Dark Core RGB Pro SE (dongle 1b1c:1b7f) speaks the newer Corsair protocol
that ckb-next calls "bragi" (USES_BRAGI in src/daemon/usb.h; bragi_proto.h,
device_bragi.c) and OpenLinkHub "slipstream" (src/devices/slipstream/): 64-byte
routed frames behind report id 0, 65 bytes to hidapi. Byte 1 is the route (0x08
the receiver itself, 0x08 | child the device behind it; 0x09 = the paired
mouse), byte 2 the command (0x02 = get) and byte 3 the property (battery level
0x0F). An answer is `[route][0x02][err][value]...`: err 0 means OK, and the
battery sits little-endian in bytes 3-4 in tenths of a percent - both drivers
divide by 10. The 1.13.0 build asked this dongle with ckb-next's "nxp" packet;
the reporter's runs in #56 showed it never answers that one, and that one of
its *other* frames parsed as a level was the 0 % flash. The request above and
its `01 02 00 26 02 ...` answer (55 %) were captured from the reporter's
dongle, and the exchange is confirmed on hardware: KKiruano's test build run
showed the same level SignalRGB does. The answer echoes the command, not the
property, so a second app on the same dongle (iCUE, SignalRGB) can put an
answer for another property on the channel that parses as a level; the ask is
therefore repeated and only two equal answers are taken, the wait is a time
window (traffic frames end a 500 ms read early), and a per-dongle budget
bounds the try-every-collection fallback (review by @ahmedkhursheed23). Only
the dongle is claimed: a wired 1b1c:1b7e exists and nothing here can prove it
answers.
