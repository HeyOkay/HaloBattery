"""HyperX Cloud III Wireless over USB/HID, without NGENUITY.

Protocol (LennardKittner/HyperHeadset's cloud_iii_wireless device, which lists these two
product ids and was written from the vendor's own traffic):

  * the dongle's vendor collection, usage page 0xFF13 / usage 0x0001. It has to be picked
    by usage: the same interface also carries the consumer-control (000c) and telephony
    (000b) collections, which are not the battery endpoint.
  * request: 62 bytes, 66 <cmd> 00 ...   (0x66 is the report id)
      cmd 0x89, battery
      cmd 0x8A, charging
  * reply: 62 bytes starting with 0x66, whose second byte is either the command echo or
    the matching response id:
      0x89 / 0x0D  battery:  reply[4] is the percent, but only when reply[2] or reply[3]
                   is non-zero - the reference treats an all-zero state as no reading yet
      0x8A / 0x0C  charging: reply[2] = 0 not charging, 1 charging, 2 fully charged,
                   anything else an error; the two non-zero cases mean on the cable
  * on Windows some HyperX dongles accept these packets as feature reports only: write()
    fails with "Incorrect function" (ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION) and the reference falls back
    to send_feature_report, so this does too. The diagnostics say which path was used,
    because that is the difference between a reading and none at all.

The Cloud II Core Wireless (03F0:0995 its dongle, 03F0:0795 the second mode the same
reporter's diagnostics show) speaks the same exchange, decoded from his own USBPcap
capture of NGENUITY in #155: NGENUITY wrote `66 89` to interface 3 as a 62-byte output
report and the dongle answered `66 89 0e d7 30 ...` (48 %), and `66 8a` was answered
`66 8a 00 00` (off the cable) - same report id, same commands, same vendor collection as
the Cloud III Wireless. The plain output report is what NGENUITY itself uses here, so
write() is the path in use; the feature fallback stays for the dongles that need it.
Both of its ids can answer in the same poll - the reporter's test-build diagnostics show
the same level and charging state on 0995 and 0795 at once while charging - so each
model's readings are merged into one icon and the charging one wins, the same rule the
ASUS provider uses for a mouse answering on its cable and receiver.

A reply that does not carry the expected command or response id is ignored, and a level
above 100 is refused rather than shown as a made-up number.
